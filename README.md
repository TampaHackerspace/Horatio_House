###Inspiration Labs - Green Tech Hackerspace

###General

This respository will serve as a collection point for various links, artifacts, and resources used to plan projects
at the Green Technologies Hackerspace in Tampa, FL.  

###Background

Inspiration Labs formed in 2013 with its main location at the CoWork Tampa offices.  A house in South Tampa was offered as
a potential donation 'space', if it could be used for planning, staging, and completing various Green Technologies Projects.
Additional intents for this hackerspace would be to conduct training and education for the community, to stage 
community-interest projects, and to use this space as a Green Technology business incubator.

###Major contacts

As of today, Facebook is the major communication hub for this project.  We will also be communicating events on Meetup. 
Join the Tampabay Hackerspace Facebook group to see all updates.  Particular contacts in this group with their roles follow:

+ **Bill Shaw** - President, Inspiration Labs
+ **Terre Tulsiak** - Space owner, Project Planning Member
+ **Chris Williams** - Project Planning Member
+ **Shane Metler** - Project Planning Member

###Project Milestones

**October    3rd, 2013** - Draft Project Artifacts are organized and shared with the Project Planning group  
**September 22nd, 2013** - Green Technologies Hackerspace project kickoff.  Met at the South Tampa house as a group to meet 
each other, discussed our particular / mutual interests in Green Technologies, and to survey the property for the deployment
of potential projects.  

###How can I help?

We have some ideas about projects, but the success of this Hackerspace will be measured by the amount of people involved,
so we welcome everyone's ideas.  As projects are organized and scheduled, we will be posting project Events in the 
Facebook group and on Meetup.com.  

We intend to use this space as a teaching platform for integrating Green Technologies in residential, urban space.  If you
would like to learn about implementing these, or would like to contribute your knowledge and skills, contact any of the 
major contacts directly through the **Tampabay Hackerspace Facebook group**, or attend our weekly **Open House meeting
at CoWork Tampa on Tuesdays from 6pm - 8pm**.
